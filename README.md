A classic Connect 4 game built using Python, featuring a simple and fun user interface. The project was created to strengthen my understanding of game logic, GUI programming, and basic AI.

ðŸŽ® Features:
Two-player mode (Player vs Player)
Clear win-detection logic (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
Color-coded game board
Smooth user experience using Tkinter
Responsive UI with reset and exit options

ðŸ§  What I Learned:
How to handle 2D arrays and grid-based game mechanics
GUI development using Tkinter
Implementing win conditions and game state management
Structuring clean and modular Python code

ðŸš€ Future Improvements:
Add single-player mode vs AI (Minimax)
Add animations and sound effects
Track score or win history
